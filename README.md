This project analyzes the mean and standard deviations of acceleration and gyro sensor data collected on test subjects while they performed various activities. The phone was used to measure various variables related to acceleration and angular velocity. 
The files included with this project are  
1. Readme.md: This readme file  
2. run_analysis.R: This script summarizes the mean and standard deviations of various measurements on a per subject+activity combination basis.  
The raw data can be downloaded from:  
[https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)   
NOTE: The raw data MUST be placed in a "UCI HAR Dataset/" subfolder under the current working directory used when executing the R script  
3. Coodebook.md file which contains a detailed description of the original raw dataset and the transformation applied
